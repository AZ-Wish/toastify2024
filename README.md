Toastify adds global hotkeys and toast notifications to Spotify.

This application uses [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET).

## Features
* Display the current playing track in a customizable toast-style popup
* Global hotkeys for media actions (Play/Pause, Next/Previous track, Mute, Fast Forward, Rewind)
* :heavy_exclamation_mark: Compatible with the Windows Store version of Spotify

## Requirements
* Windows (7, 8/8.1, 10)
* .NET Framework 4.5.2
* Spotify

## Notice
Toastify is **not** a Spotify **replacement**. You need both running at the same time.
