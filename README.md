# Toastify

This project is a fork of the original [aleab/Toastify](https://github.com/aleab/toastify) project, which has been archived by the owner on Feb 2, 2023. This fork is intended to keep the project alive and functional, and maybe add new features and improvements.

Another updated working version is available from  [IceyFL/Toastify](https://github.com/IceyFL/Fixed-Toastify)

* :heavy_exclamation_mark: Compatible with the Microsoft Store version of Spotify

- [AudioBand](https://github.com/AudioBand/AudioBand)
- [Lofi](https://github.com/dvx/lofi)

or use Spotify's own overlay on Windows (check out [this article](https://www.alphr.com/spotify-overlay-with-game-windows/)).

## Notices
* Toastify is **not** a Spotify **replacement**. You need both running at the same time.
* **Windows**: In the latest versions of Windows, SmartScreen will probably prevent the installer from starting, because it is not signed.  
  You have two options: either *Don't run* the installer and forget about Toastify, or click on *More info* and *Run anyway*.  
  Whatever is your choice, I strongly advise you to **not** disable Windows SmartScreen â€” its warnings are meaningful.  

  If you have any concerns, feel free to take a look at the code (it's free :wink:) and ask questions in the [issues][issues] section.
* If you are updating from the original version of Toastify (v1.8.3), be sure to uninstall it completely before installing this version. You should also remove any file from the following directories, if they exist:
  - *"%LocalAppData%\Toastify"* (for example: *"C:\Users\{UserName}\AppData\Local\Toastify"*)
  - *"%AppData%\Toastify"* (for example: *"C:\Users\\UserName}\AppData\Roaming\Toastify"*)

This version of Toastify use the configuration and log files found at these locations:
* Log: 		%LOCALAPPDATA%\Toastify\Toastify.log
* Config: 	%APPDATA%\Toastify\Toastify.cfg
